# 3DChess

THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETED IT'S STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!

hello this project is a simple 3Dchess game with a local host multiplayer it's a fun game based on chess with special moves and simple rules
although it's still not complete because i gotta add an online gameplay so everyone can play this game around the world!!
currently u can just play localy with someone near you physically or using local connection from the same wifi , or connecting through the router IP by unlocking the port connection for someone
i might add a lobby and a dedicated server so everyone can join and play and have fun!!
if you have any idea that can help me do this please feel free to contact me through my email or any social app that i've linked in my profile
and thank you!!
